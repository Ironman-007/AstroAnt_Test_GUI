# AstroAnt Dashboard
Python program that emulates the frontend. Connects to central via RSS422 and sends/receives commands.

## Setup and dependencies
The dashboard requires installing [Python3](https://realpython.com/installing-python/) and pip3. Make sure they are installed on your machine and available as commands from the command line.

To install the required dependencies of the project run the following command in the `AstroAnt_Dashboard` folder:
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
*Note: Depending on how you installed pip3, change "pip3" to "pip". You can always check the version of pip by running `pip3 -v` or `pip -v`*

## Running the dashboard
To run the dashboard, navigate to the `AstroAnt_Dashboard` folder from your command line. Then run:
```bash
python3 server.py
```
*Note: Depending on how you installed python3, change "python3" to just "python". You can always check the version of python by running `python3 --version` or `python --version`*

You can now open the dashboard in your browser (latest version of Chrome recommended) by navigating to:
```bash
http://localhost:8000
```
